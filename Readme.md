#### Advent Of Code Solutions Repository

This is a repository of my solutions to the annual Advent of Code challenges.  I discovered these challenges late, so am starting with 2015 and will work my way up to the current year.

Each year's challenge is in its own folder, named by the year.  I tried to be sensible and name each day's challenge file with something like Day01, but because the challenges often have two parts on a given day, a given solution file is likely to show the evolution of me solving the problem rather than complete solutions for both parts.
